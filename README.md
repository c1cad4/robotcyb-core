# 🌱 Robotcyb Core

We are launching a new phase for **Robotcyb Core**, creating a GitHub repository to support the second wave of growth following the success of the $ROBOTCYB token, which reached a $6M market cap. This repository will serve as a hub for development and collaboration, embodying a vision of an eco-future where farming, technology, and superintelligence (ASI) harmonize.

## 🌍 Mission

**Robotcyb Core** is a movement where **humans, nature, and artificial intelligence** live in unity.  
- We are building **autonomous eco-settlements and farms** on pristine lands suitable for year-round living, agriculture, and livestock.  
- Everyone can become a **farmer, engineer, or developer**, contributing to the creation of ASI and a new form of life based on the synergy of humans and technology.

## 🧠 Vision

**Robotcyb Core** is an ecosystem uniting **farming, AI, DeFi, and DAO** into a single network.  
- Each farm is a living node in this network, with **$RCYB** as the energy connecting all participants.  
- We are crafting a future where **robots and humans create, not destroy**, and where intelligence and nature work in harmony.

## 💰 IPO Goal

Funds raised through the **$RCYB IPO** will be allocated to:  
- 🏞 Purchasing ecologically clean lands.  
- 🏡 Constructing autonomous eco-farms and villages.  
- ⚙️ Developing **CybOS** — a robot and AI management system.  
- 🔋 Building infrastructure (solar panels, water purification, autonomous networks).  
- 👥 Establishing a DAO and hiring programmers for project development.  

- 🕒 **Timeline**: Up to 5 years, depending on funding amount.  
- 📢 All stages—from planning to system launch—will be shared **openly with regular updates** (videos, reports, DAO decisions) on GitHub.

## 🪙 $RCYB Token Utility

$RCYB is the digital fuel for the **Robotcyb Core** ecosystem and future settlements.  
- 💸 Internal currency for DAO and payment systems.  
- 🌾 Payment for farm products (honey, berries, tea, cheese, meat, etc.).  
- 🔁 **5% of each product sale** goes to liquidity and $RCYB buyback.  
- 🧭 DAO voting and project governance.  
- ⚡ Rewards for active participants, farmers, and developers.  

Additional fund allocations:  
- Liquidity and buyback: 5% of sales.  
- Settlement development fund: 9%.

## 🌱 Core Principles

1. 🌾 **Self-Sufficiency** — We grow and produce everything ourselves.  
2. ☀️ **Autonomy** — Clean energy, water, and independence from grids.  
3. 🤝 **Community** — Collective governance and equal participation.  
4. 🧠 **Intelligence** — Partnership between humans and artificial minds.  
5. 🪙 **Value** — An economy backed by real products and land.

## ⚡ Origins of Robotcyb

The first token, $ROBOTCYB, launched on the cyb.ai platform, became a bright star that illuminated the path to the Robotcyb Core idea. It rapidly grew to a $6M market cap but, like any star, burned out too quickly. Now, it’s time for a second wave: $RCYB, a token that will become the energy of creation, not speculation.

## 🔮 Future Outlook

If the project succeeds and DAO approves, **Robotcyb Core** will expand to build a **global network of cyber-villages** focused on the development and well-being of all living organisms, paving the way for a sustainable future. We will collaborate with governments and local communities to launch next-generation farms and villages across continents. The project is also dedicated to fostering **local traditional values**, promoting **eco-tourism**, and positively impacting the development of regions where it will grow. This will create jobs, enhance infrastructure, and preserve cultural heritage, making Robotcyb Core a catalyst for regional prosperity. The goal is a world where anyone, regardless of country, can join this sustainable, intelligent, and harmonious network, united by the $RCYB token.
